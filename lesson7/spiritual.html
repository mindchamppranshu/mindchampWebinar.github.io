<p>Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu culture and history, 
and was established in the 16th and 17th centuries as a result of an explicit
 treaty between Muslims and Hindu Emperors,[13] and is an 
important Hindu pilgrimage site since long.
Of the contemporary times, Vallabhacharya, aged eleven visited Vrind
avan. Later on, he performed three pilgrimages of India, barefoo
t giving discourses on Bhagavad Gita at 84 places. These 84 places 
are known as Pushtimarg Baithak and since then are the places of pilgrimage.
 Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan for four months each year. Vrindavan
 thus heavily influenced his formation of Pushtimarg.</p>
